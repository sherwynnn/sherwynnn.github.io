## Overview

*lategame* was a fun side project that me and a good friend decided to create as a way to combine both of our respective fields of study — technology and finance — into something practical and impactful.

The main base of this project is a portfolio analyzer that helps users to identify suitable stocks and asset classes based on fundamental analysis, making investing easier and more efficient. 

At the same time, the web application serves as a news resource for relevant financial articles simplified into bite-sized insights using references from pop culture and video games.

## Why did we choose to create this?

When both of us started our investing journey earlier in our lives, we were rather overwhelmed by the sheer amount of complex financial jargon and concepts. As polytechnic students studying accounting at the time, trying to make heads or tails of "beginner-friendly" resources online felt like studying for a whole new module by itself. [(This was my first introduction to investing, and at the time I didn't understand half of the terms that were written on it)](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/j7f815/starting_guide_to_fi/)

Much like how students understand concepts better through analogies as a cognitive learning strategy, we felt that breaking financial concepts down into something familiar would help newcomers to understand these financial concepts more in-depth, even if they had no background knowledge whatsoever. We decided on pop and video game culture as our application basis for 2 reasons:
- These are popular concepts that are usually more engaging and easier to follow for younger people getting into investing.
- This is somewhat similar to how both of us used to study for examinations, where we would associate key concepts with analogies of video games (at times, nonsensical) that we were playing at the time to verify our understanding of the topic. [(This article explains the concept of analogical reasoning in detail)](https://www.lifescied.org/doi/10.1187/cbe.22-05-0084)

## Research

Before starting the design process, I analyzed direct competitors that offered portfolio analytical tools to identify their strengths and weaknesses. As our approach is to target newcomer investors with little or no background knowledge, we reviewed each competitor's respective features and decided which were the core features to settle on when creating the web application.

For instance, competitors such as [Portfolio Visualizer](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/analysis) have a wide range of specialised features that would be useful to the seasoned investor, and vice versa for a new investor. The manner in which the information is displayed might seem intimidating for new investors, so we broke down all of the features offered and mainly considered core features that were more relevant to be built into the web application.

_Behind all this jargon, this is essentially a portfolio allocation model_

On the other hand, competitors such as [iShares BlackRock](https://www.blackrock.com/au/solutions/tools/etf-porfolio-builder-tool#/) expect users to know the products beforehand, which poses a challenge for new investors. Usability problems were immediately identified as I could not proceed unless the allocation fields added up to 100%, and I had to scroll back and forth countless times due to all of the fields being stacked on top of each other vertically. 

Although this instance was a minor in-built tool that gives a general idea (maybe even too general) of how the portfolio would look, we used it as a negative example that we could learn from, especially when crafting the personalised portfolio building process for the web app.

## Approach

### Branding Considerations

What does "lategame" represent?

In TCG (trading card games) terminology, lategame refers to the later stages of a match between 2 players where both players have accumulated a substantial amount of resources (cards in hand, creatures on board, mana, etc). These stages also tend to be more strategic as the match would shift to a player's advantage depending on the amount of resources they have and choose to utilise on their turn, which we found to be rather similar to investing as an abstract concept. 

Much like how lategame TCG decks are built to scale and thrive in the final turns of the match through careful planning and balance, a well-structured investment portfolio works similarly. The earlier and more strategically one starts and builds their portfolio, the more they stand to benefit in the future.

### Website

The main website serves as the branding platform for the web app, where CTAs (Calls-to-action) are positioned all around the website to encourage visitors to sign up.

Detailed pricing plans are included to compare pricing options and increase conversion levels.

The website also functions as a content portal for visitors and users alike to read articles and actively participate in the comments to share their thoughts.

_Featured articles on the landing page_

An interactive glossary pops up at the side of the page when a financial term (usually a hyperlink) is clicked. I took inspiration from Genius' website layout, where the site splits into 2 portions when a lyric is selected.

A comments section helps to increase community engagement, encouraging users to sign up and join in the conversation.

The glossary, as mentioned above, also has a dedicated catalogue to show all the terms that have been condensed.

### Web Application

The user will first have to log in before accessing the web app.

_Logging into the page_

_Logging in / Signing up / Signing up (filled information)_

The dashboard shows all the important information that should be condensed into a singular page. The whole idea is to give the user a clear overview of their portfolios and their associated statistics, as well as accessible quick CTA buttons to the full pages if required.

Each stock that is monitored by the system has its dedicated page with the relevant information and scores that are derived through the risk analysis algorithm, which currently exists as a prototype. As much as possible, the page aims to deliver both quantitative and qualitative insights in a refined layout that is easy to digest, providing comprehensive information such as performance ratios, historical charts and news articles that pertain to the stock in question.

To maintain the beginner-friendly nature of the web application, each term has a pop-up when hovered to show its condensed explanation, as well as a link to its glossary page with its analogous explanations.

The risk analysis algorithm uses 7 metrics to calculate the stock's overall risk factor that determines its degree of investability. True to the project's core inspiration, the display of this widget takes reference from video game interfaces (namely character stats) to display the score of the stock.

The mobile responsive design accommodates future plans to port the web application into a native iOS/Android application. At this point, mobile responsive design is a standard expectation for modern web development, thus it probably needs no justification against it at this point.

## What's next?

Currently, I am developing the front-end of the website using React with Vite, while also figuring out how I can continue to make it more interactive than it is now. After that, the next step is to start developing the web application and figure out a way to port it into a native iOS/Android application, though that comes much later on.

_Work in progress..._

Throughout the process of designing this project with my friend, I’ve learned quite a lot about investing concepts and strategies through research, where our fortnightly collaborative sessions allowed us to exchange new perspectives and challenge each other's thinking. It's been a rather enjoyable experience to work together again after nearly five years since polytechnic (multiplayer games don't count) — and both of us are committed to bringing *lategame* to life in the future.
