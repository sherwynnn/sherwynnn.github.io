## Hey! I'm Sherwyn.

I'm an aspiring UI/UX designer and frontend developer based in Singapore.

I live for the challenge of turning complex problems into simplistic solutions, and I'm driven by the idea of creating user experiences that people are naturally inclined to continue using over and over again.

## My personal design philosophy

- :open_book: Storytelling brings designs to life
- :gear: Achieving simplicity is complex by nature (what an oxymoron)
- :bulb: Edge cases are a byproduct of out-of-the-box creativity
- :arrows_counterclockwise: If at first you don't succeed, try again, again and again (and again...)

### Favourite books of all time

- When Breath Becomes Air _by Paul Kalanithi_
- A Personal Matter _by Kenzaburō Ōe_
- Medium Raw _by Anthony Bourdain_
